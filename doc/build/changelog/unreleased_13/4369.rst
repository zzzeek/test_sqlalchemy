   Updated the parameters that can be sent to the cx_Oracle DBAPI to both allow
   for all current parameters as well as for future parameters not added yet.
   In addition, removed unused parameters that were deprecated in version 1.2,
   and additionally we are now defaulting "threaded" to False.
